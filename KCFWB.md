# Important Parts of a Web Browser

## User Interface
The visual elements the user interacts with.

## Browser Engine
Acts like a bridge between the UI and the Rendering Engine.

## Rendering Engine
Responsible for displaying web content on screen.

## Networking Component
Handles communication with servers using HTTP and HTTPS by encrypting data with Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS).
- When a user enters a URL, the browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server hosting the website.

## JavaScript Engine
Executes JavaScript code in websites.

## Data Storage
- Local Storage
- Cookies
- Cache

## Fixing Internet Performance Issues
- **Caching**: Browsers save copies of frequently accessed resources (like images or scripts) to load pages faster on subsequent visits.
- **Compression**: Support for technologies like Gzip reduces the size of transmitted data.
- **Lazy Loading**: Postpones loading non-critical resources (e.g., images) until needed, improving initial load time.
- **Debugging Tools**: Built-in developer tools help diagnose issues, such as slow-loading elements or network bottlenecks.

## Role in Working with Web Servers
- **Request-Response Cycle**: Browsers send requests to servers and render the responses (e.g., displaying a webpage after an HTML file is fetched).
- **Script Execution**: Browsers execute client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) embedded in web pages. For server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Python), they communicate with the server, which processes the script and sends back the result (e.g., a dynamically generated page).

## IoT Devices and Browsers
- **Managing IoT Devices**: Browsers often provide user interfaces for configuring and controlling IoT devices through local or cloud-based web portals.
- **Displaying Data**: IoT devices (e.g., smart thermostats, security cameras) send data to servers, and browsers visualize this data through dashboards or reports.
- **Protocols and Communication**: For secure communication with IoT devices, browsers use HTTPS or specialized protocols like MQTT over web sockets.
